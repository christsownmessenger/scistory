          <h2 class="neon">The Mysteries of Black Holes</h2>
          <p class="lead">Black holes are one of the universe's most enigmatic phenomena, challenging our understanding of physics.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:28px">
        <article>
          <p>Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, creating a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. This makes them invisible and detectable only through their interactions with surrounding matter.</p>

          <p>Scientists study black holes by observing the effects of their gravity on nearby stars and gas. The Event Horizon Telescope, for example, captured the first image of a black hole's event horizon in 2019, providing valuable insights into their structure and behavior.</p>

          <p>Despite their name, black holes do not "suck" everything in. Their gravitational influence extends only so far, and objects can orbit them safely at a distance. However, if an object gets too close, it can be pulled in and crushed to infinite density at the singularity.</p>

          <p>But the mystery begins when we ask deeper questions:</p>

          <h3>The Event Horizon</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>What happens at the event horizon, the point of no return?</li>
            <li>Can information that falls into a black hole ever be retrieved?</li>
            <li>How do black holes influence the formation and evolution of galaxies?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>Black holes pose significant challenges to our understanding of physics. The laws of general relativity break down at the singularity, where density becomes infinite. Additionally, the nature of dark matter and dark energy remains elusive, with black holes potentially playing a key role in these mysteries.</p>

          <h3>The Singularity</h3>
          <p>At the very center, black holes are thought to have a “singularity”—a point of infinite density where space and time break down. But infinities don’t sit well with physics. Many scientists think our current theories (like Einstein’s relativity) don’t fully capture what happens there. A theory of quantum gravity may reveal the truth.</p>

          <h3>Information Paradox</h3>
          <p>The information paradox arises from the question: if information falls into a black hole, does it disappear forever? This challenges our understanding of quantum mechanics and the nature of information itself. Some theories suggest that information may be preserved in some form, while others propose that it is lost, leading to a fundamental conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>
          <p>Stephen Hawking showed that black holes can emit radiation (now called Hawking radiation) and could eventually evaporate. But this raises a puzzle: what happens to the information about everything that fell inside? Physics says information cannot be destroyed, but if a black hole disappears, where does it go? This paradox still drives much debate.</p>

          <h3>Wormholes & Alternate Realities?</h3>
          <p>Some theories suggest that black holes could be connected to wormholes—hypothetical passages through spacetime that might create shortcuts for travel between distant parts of the universe. This raises intriguing possibilities about alternate realities and the nature of our universe.</p>
          <p>Some theories suggest that black holes might be portals—wormholes—connecting different parts of the universe or even other universes. This is highly speculative, but it fuels a lot of sci-fi and genuine physics research.</p>

          <h3>Time and Black Holes</h3>
          <p>Black holes also challenge our understanding of time. Near a black hole, time behaves differently due to the intense gravitational field. According to general relativity, time slows down in stronger gravitational fields—a phenomenon known as time dilation. This means that an observer far from a black hole would see objects falling into it moving slower and slower, never quite appearing to cross the event horizon.</p>
          <p>Near a black hole, time itself slows down relative to distant observers. If you watched someone fall into one (without dying instantly), you’d see them freeze in time at the event horizon. For them, though, time would feel normal. This distortion of time is one of the strangest effects of relativity.</p>

          <p><strong>Rise:</strong> Military strength + smart politics + infrastructure + expansion.

            <strong>Fall:</strong> Corruption + weak leadership + overexpansion + economic troubles + invasions.</p>

          <h3>The Rise of Rome</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Beginnings (509 BCE): Rome started as a small city-state after overthrowing its kings and becoming a Republic.</li>
            <li>Expansion: Through strong armies, smart alliances, and efficient organization, Rome conquered the Italian Peninsula, then spread across the Mediterranean (defeating Carthage in the Punic Wars).</li>
            <li>From Republic to Empire: Internal struggles, civil wars, and powerful generals (like Julius Caesar) weakened the Republic. Caesar’s assassination (44 BCE) set the stage for his heir Octavian (Augustus) to become the first emperor in 27 BCE.</li>
            <li>Golden Age (1st–2nd centuries CE): The Pax Romana (“Roman Peace”) brought stability, trade, engineering wonders (roads, aqueducts, the Colosseum), and cultural achievements. Rome was at its peak under emperors like Augustus, Trajan, and Marcus Aurelius.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Fall of Rome</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Internal Problems: Corruption, political instability (emperors were often overthrown), and economic troubles weakened the empire.</li>
            <li>Overexpansion: Rome became too large to govern effectively, stretching from Britain to the Middle East.</li>
            <li>Division (285 CE): Emperor Diocletian split the empire into East and West to manage it better. The Eastern Empire (Byzantium) survived for another thousand years, but the Western Empire grew weaker.</li>
            <li>Barbarian Invasions: Germanic tribes, Huns, and others attacked Roman territories. Rome couldn’t defend its borders well anymore.</li>
            <li>The End (476 CE): The Western Roman Empire officially fell when the Germanic leader Odoacer deposed the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus.</li>
          </ul>
